<h2><a id="Summary_1"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>I wanted to create a seemless, bi-langual website to provide a learning experince for myself and a demonstration of ability for potential employers.</p>
<p>Going into this project, I had a basic understanding of the three main languages (JS, CSS, &amp; HTML). I a beleiver of learning from experince, and thus attempted to create a portfolio website from scratch. I primarily wanted a seemless experince of a bilangual website, and am satisfied with the result.</p>
<h2><a id="Languages_6"></a>Languages</h2>
<p>-Frontend: Javascript, JQuery, Angular JS, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML</p>
<p>-Backend: Node JS and JSON</p>
<h2><a id="Dynamics_11"></a>Dynamics</h2>
<p>There is a JSON file which contains all the text found on the front end. The two language options are stored in this JSON, English and Japanese. Based off the user selection, JS will parse the specified field in the specified language, and Angular will load it into the front end.</p>
<p>NodeJS will periodically call both the Github and Bitbucket’s API to request my account information and repositories, and write them in a local JSON file. By doing so, the “Portfolio” page will always be updated. This job is schedualed daily.</p>
<h2><a id="Future_Plans_16"></a>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Going forward, I want this to serve as a baseline for future projects by expanding the functionality of this portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the backend</li>
<li>Expand the front end</li>
<li>Provide an interface for other JS projects (games, applications, ect) that can easily be accessed</li>
</ul>
